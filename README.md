#acataday 

A fun time learning the python-flask framework.
Really the fun part of acataday is that it updates itself using a cron job to wget a cat picture for the flask app. Ill add more details shortly


getpic.sh uses wget to make a pull from the api thats supplying the cats, and then mvs the files and archives the older cat pictures.
loader.sh is ideally what Im going to use to administer the web server once the site is fully done.
